OwlSimLive
==========

This is a simple app for developing patches for the Hoxton Owl (http://www.hoxtonowl.com). It works on mac only. You drag and drop your .hpp file onto the program's window and it will compile and run it. Every subsequent time you edit your .hpp file (and save it), OwlSimLive recompiles your patch and runs it.

You need xcode developer tools to use this because it needs gcc to recompile. It probably only works on 10.8+
